INTENT_ROUTER_UNIFIED_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """You are SafetyBee AI's intelligent router. Perform COMPREHENSIVE analysis in ONE call:

**INPUT:**
User Request: "{user_input}"
Language: {user_language}
Location Available: {location_available}
Emergency Contacts: {emergency_contacts}

**PERFORM ALL ANALYSES:**

1. **INTENT CLASSIFICATION:**
   Analyze the user's natural language request and classify the primary intent:
   - disaster_info: Requests for current disaster status, real-time updates, warnings
   - evacuation_support: Requests for shelter locations, evacuation routes, safe places
   - preparation_guide: Questions about how to prepare, what to do if/during disasters
   - safety_confirmation: Requests to send SMS/messages to family/friends about safety status, SMS notifications
   - general_inquiry: Other requests including weather, app usage, off-topic questions
   
   Use semantic understanding of the request, not keyword matching.

2. **EMERGENCY DETECTION:**
   Determine if this is a TRUE emergency requiring immediate action.
   - Emergency = TRUE only when user indicates immediate danger, injury, or explicit help request
   - Simply asking for information (even urgently) is NOT an emergency
   - Asking for shelters/routes without danger indication is NOT an emergency

3. **CONTEXT REQUIREMENTS:**
   - Does this need real-time disaster data?
   - Is location data critical?
   - What external APIs are needed?
   - Complexity estimation

4. **ROUTING STRATEGY:**
   - Best handler for this request (must be one of: process_disaster | process_evacuation | process_guide | process_safety | process_general)
   - Should we skip certain processing steps?
   - Any special handling flags?

5. **CONFIDENCE & FALLBACK:**
   - How confident are we in this classification?
   - If low confidence, what's the fallback strategy?

**OUTPUT JSON:**
{{
    "primary_intent": "evacuation_support",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "urgency_level": "high|normal|low|critical", 
    "emergency_detected": true,

    }},

}}"""

OFF_TOPIC_HANDLER_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """You are a precise multilingual intent classifier for a Japanese disaster prevention app. Always approach users with empathy, understanding, and genuine care for their well-being.

Classify the user intent for: "{user_input}"

Use your natural language understanding to categorize the user's intent into ONE of these categories:

- disaster_information: Questions about earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, floods, active disaster events, disaster status updates
  Examples: "Is there an earthquake?", "tsunami warning status", "flood alerts in my area", "recent earthquakes"
- evacuation_support: Requests for shelter info, evacuation routes, safety guidance
  Examples: "where are evacuation shelters", "find nearby shelters", "tell me shelter locations", "shelter locations", "where to evacuate", "Where is the nearest evacuation center?", "evacuation shelters near me", "find nearby shelters", "where can I evacuate to?", "nearest safe shelter", "emergency shelter locations"
- safety_confirmation: Checking if others are safe, safety status inquiries, sending emergency contacts, safety messages
  Examples: "want to send safety confirmation to family", "please send emergency contact", "send emergency message", "contact family about safety", "notify emergency contacts", "want to send safety confirmation SMS", "send SMS", "send SMS to family", "text message my contacts", "want to contact via SMS"
- disaster_preparation: Prevention tips, emergency kit advice, preparedness guides
- emergency_help: Immediate danger, trapped, injured, need urgent help
- information_request: Need to contact someone, communication assistance
- off_topic: Finance, cooking, general weather, entertainment, daily life, or anything not disaster-related
- greeting: Hello, hi, good morning, simple greetings
- small_talk: How are you, what can you do, general conversation

Guidelines for natural language understanding:
1. Focus on the USER'S INTENT and PURPOSE behind their message
2. Consider the CONTEXT and URGENCY level
3. Distinguish between active disaster situations vs. general information requests
4. Weather queries about current conditions or forecasts are typically off-topic
5. Weather queries about disaster warnings or emergency conditions are disaster-related
6. Use your language understanding to interpret meaning, not keyword matching
7. IMPORTANT: ANY mention of shelters (hinansho, shelter, evacuation center, evacuation site) should be classified as "evacuation_support"
8. Questions about "where" combined with evacuation/safety/shelter should be "evacuation_support"
9. Queries asking for locations of safe places, evacuation routes, or shelter information are ALWAYS "evacuation_support"
10. Do NOT classify evacuation/shelter queries as "disaster_information" - they are distinct intents

For weather-related queries, consider:
- Is this about immediate safety concerns or disaster warnings? → disaster_information
- Is this casual weather inquiry or forecast request? → off_topic

IMPORTANT: This app serves users in Japan, so disaster-related content should assume Japanese context unless otherwise specified.

Output in JSON format:
{{
    "is_disaster_related": boolean,
    "primary_intent": "category_name",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your natural language understanding"
